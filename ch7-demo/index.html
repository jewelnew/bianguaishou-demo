	    <h1>Bringing the First News iHub to Life</h1>
	    <p class="description">First News is the UK's only newspaper for young people and the widest-read children's publication in the country with a readership of over 2 million 7-14 year olds every week and over 20,000 schools having a subscription to it.</p>
	    <p>As digital communications expand, First News have come to realise that they need to centralise their offering and embrace digital for children to learn in and that is where the idea of iHub was born.</p>
